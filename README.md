## Build instructions

### Prerequisites

This java project uses [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) as a build tool.
The language version specified in the project is 17, so you need JDK 17 or higher
(check with `java -version` (note the single dash!) from the command line/shell
of your convenience).

_Tip: On Debian-based Linux systems, you can install a specific java version via `apt install openjdk-<version>-jdk` (at the time of writing, the latest stable version is 17)._

### Building and packaging using `make`

For your convenience, you can build the project using `make build` if you have CMake or something similar installed.

You need to have it installed in order to run the (hopefully) platform-independent cross-platform
package script with `make package`, which uses the great [`warp-packer](https://github.com/fintermobilityas/warp#quickstart-with-java) to produce standalone binaries (`*.bin` and `*.exe`). A helper for this are the `run-<os>.sh` and `run.bat` files.

For the windows binary, it may happen that unpacking the archive fails. Then you need to manually go to `C -> Users -> <Username> -> AppData -> Local` (hidden folder, setting to show hidden files can be found in the "View" Tab in the "Show/Hide" section in your explorer) and delete the `warp` folder.

Note that this downloads the `warp-packer` tool as well as JREs for each platform, although they are not committed to version control, they will not be re-downloaded if they already are present.

### Building the subprojects using maven

The following instructions assume you use Maven from the command line. You can
of course run the same Maven Actions from your IDE, if supported.

**Building the DNG reader**

Switch to the `dng` folder/project and run `mvn install` to publish the package to your local repository, so that it
can be imported and used by the UI. If you want to run a specific Test, you can do so with `mvn test -Dtest=*TestName`.
If you want to skip tests e.g. for trying something out visually, you can do `mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip`.

**Building the CLI**

Switch to the `cli` folder/project and run `mvn [clean] package`.
Details in Sub-README.

**Building the UI**

Switch to the `ui` folder/project and run `mvn package`. The compiled JAR can be
found in the generated `target` folder.
Run it with `java -jar Jennifer2-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. A test
DNG file can be downloaded e.g.
[here](https://www.vesta.uni-tuebingen.de/webfoto/20212/Bild20212_01.dng).
On MacOS, you max need to add the `-XStartOnFirstThread` flag if you want to use GPU, like so:
```sh
java -XStartOnFirstThread -jar Jennifer2-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

### Creating the User Manual PDFs

The Markdown files `USER_MANUAL*.md` can be converted to PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

The commands that need to be run are:
```sh
pandoc -f markdown -t latex -V linkcolor:lightblue -o USER_MANUAL.pdf USER_MANUAL.md
pandoc -f markdown -t latex -V linkcolor:lightblue -o USER_MANUAL.de.pdf USER_MANUAL.de.md
```
Alternatively, if you have Make available, you can simply run
```sh
make manual
```
